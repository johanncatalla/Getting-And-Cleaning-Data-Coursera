# Data Cleaning Project

This repository contains the R script and documentation for the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset cleaning project. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to clean and transform raw data into a tidy dataset suitable for analysis.

## Files

- `run_analysis.R`: The R script that performs data download, cleaning, merging, and tidy dataset creation.
- `CodeBook.md`: Describes the data, variables, and the transformation process.
- `tidy.txt`: The final tidy dataset output.

## Project Overview

This project follows the requirements of the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course. It includes:

1. Downloading and preparing the dataset.
2. Merging training and test data.
3. Extracting mean and standard deviation measurements.
4. Applying descriptive activity names.
5. Labeling the dataset with meaningful variable names.
6. Creating a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
